## Course: ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow, and Kafka

### What I Learned

- **ETL vs ELT:** I gained a deep understanding of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) processes, learning how to describe and contrast them effectively.
- **Batch vs Concurrent Execution:** I can now explain the differences between batch and concurrent modes of execution in data pipelines, understanding when to utilize each method.
- **Shell Scripting:** Through hands-on exercises, I learned to implement ETL pipelines using shell scripting, enhancing my proficiency in automating data workflows.
- **Data Pipeline Components:** I acquired knowledge about the various components, processes, tools, and technologies involved in building robust data pipelines, including Shell, Airflow, and Kafka.

### Why This Course Matters

This course equipped me with essential skills in data engineering, enabling me to design, develop, and maintain efficient data pipelines. By mastering ETL processes and tools like Shell, Airflow, and Kafka, I am better prepared to tackle complex data challenges and contribute effectively to projects requiring data integration, transformation, and analysis.

I'm excited to leverage my newfound expertise to drive actionable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making in real-world scenarios.
